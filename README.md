   Challenges and Learnings along the way 🤯
   </h2>

   In the development of these applications, I learned a lot about logic, folder organization, and I had a new idea and learned about [Flutter Widgets](https://flutter.dev/docs/development/ui/widgets).<br>
   I got along well with the development of this application. Unfortunately there was a silly error that cost me a certain amount of time, and the only thing I should have done was to give a "Flutter Pub Get" in Terminal, fortunately, I found this solution, and the application works normally in version 1.0.0.
